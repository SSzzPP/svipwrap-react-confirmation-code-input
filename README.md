# react-confirmation-code-input

This library provides a hook that lets you write a confirmation code input component while the library manages the refs and some interactions like focusing the next input element when an input has been entered.

It also provides you a component based on top of the hook with very basic styling. You can override the input and container elements' styling by adding a class name of your choice.
